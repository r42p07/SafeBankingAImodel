# SafeBanking_AI_Model
## OpenSource_Start_up_Project
###  What does this project do?
Safe Banking is a startup project aimed at designing a machine learning model to detect abnormal numbers and figures in banking data. By using this model, human errors in monetary transactions can be identified, as well as the potential for money laundering, fraud or other abnormal transactions. The customers for this product will be banks.

## Description
