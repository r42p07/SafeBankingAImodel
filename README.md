# SafeBanking_AI_Model
## OpenSource_Start_up_Project
###  What does this project do?
Safe Banking is a startup project aimed at designing a machine learning model to detect abnormal numbers and figures in banking data. By using this model, human errors in monetary transactions can be identified, as well as the potential for money laundering, fraud or other abnormal transactions. The customers for this product will be banks.

## Description

This project uses various machine learning algorithms to classify fraudulent and non-fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle, containing transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.

## Getting Started
```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/r42p07/SafeBankingAImodel.git](https://github.com/r42p07/SafeBankingAImodel/edit/main/README.md)
```
